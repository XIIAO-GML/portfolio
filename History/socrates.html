      <P><strong>Brief History</strong> Socrates (c. 470–399 BCE) was a Greek philosopher from Athens and is considered one of the founders of Western philosophy. He never wrote any books himself, but his teachings and ideas were recorded by his students, especially Plato.

Socrates was born in Athens, probably around 470 BCE. His father was a stone mason, and his mother was a midwife. He grew up in a time when Athens was a powerful city-state known for its culture, politics, and war. Unlike many other philosophers of his time, Socrates didn't teach in a formal school. Instead, he walked around the streets, markets, and public spaces of Athens, asking people deep and sometimes uncomfortable questions about life, justice, virtue, and knowledge.

His method of teaching, now called the Socratic method, involved asking a series of questions that made people think and challenge their assumptions. Rather than giving answers, he helped people discover the truth through dialogue. He believed that wisdom began with knowing how little we actually know.

Socrates became known for his sharp mind, his commitment to truth, and his refusal to follow the crowd. However, not everyone liked him. Some powerful Athenians felt he was corrupting the youth and disrespecting the gods. In 399 BCE, he was put on trial and found guilty of impiety and corrupting the minds of young people. He was sentenced to death and chose to drink a cup of poison hemlock instead of fleeing or begging for mercy.

Socrates’ death shocked many, and it became one of the most famous moments in the history of philosophy. His ideas lived on through the writings of Plato, who used Socrates as a main character in many of his philosophical dialogues.

Today, Socrates is remembered as a symbol of wisdom, free thinking, and intellectual honesty. His life and death taught the world the importance of questioning everything and standing up for what you believe in—even at great personal cost.</P></div>
